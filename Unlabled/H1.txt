Dog Day Afternoon of the Dead”? Sure, why not. In “Cockneys vs. Zombies,” when zombies bust out of a construction site and run roughshod over East London, it falls to a gang of dim bank robbers (Rasmus Hardiker and Harry Treadaway play the leaders) and their hostages, plus some retirees at the local old-age home, to load some shotguns and get to work.
The senior citizens (actors include the fantastically irascible Alan Ford and Honor Blackman, Pussy Galore of “Goldfinger”) are a bit slow to catch on: “It’s obvious, isn’t it? They’re vampires!” But they soon find that having, for instance, a prosthetic leg can be an advantage: a zombie may get confused and start munching on it. Meanwhile, one group of soccer-hooligan zombies takes on another, proving that death is no impediment to pure tribal idiocy. And there’s a zombie baby who winds up getting punted against an anti-cruelty-to-children billboard.
