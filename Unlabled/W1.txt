CROSS-COUNTRY’S RACE WITHIN A RACE FUELLED BY OLYMPIC SPIRIT
A SPONTANEOUS SHOW OF SPORTSMANSHIP AND COURAGE AT THE BACK OF THE FIELD MANAGED TO RIVAL THE MOMENTOUS ACHIEVEMENT OF A FOURTH GOLD MEDAL FOR SWITZERLAND’S DARIO COLOGNA IN THE MEN’S 15KM FREE CROSS COUNTRY RACE AT THE OLYMPIC WINTER GAMES.In a field of 116 competitors to finish one of the toughest races in cross-country skiing, the first 80 astonishingly finished within five minutes of Cologna’s time, amid scenes of spent athletes at the finishing line writhing in the discomfort of their lung-busting exertion.Yet as the shadows grew longer, another group approached the line. None of these competitors harboured realistic hopes of winning the men’s 15km free. All hailed from countries where cross-country skiing has no tradition or infrastructure. Here, the race was to simply finish.
