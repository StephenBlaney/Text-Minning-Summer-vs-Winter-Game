RELIVE THE ACTION FROM 13 AUGUST 2016 IN RIO ON OLYMPIC.ORG. THE EIGHTH DAY OF COMPETITION MARKED THE END OF THE SWIMMING EVENTS, WITH MICHAEL PHELPS CLAIMING A 23RD GOLD MEDAL.

PHELPS GOES FASTER, HIGHER AND STRONGER
As the swimming events at the Rio Games reached their conclusion, the final curtain fell on the glittering career of Michael Phelps. A career that ended, naturally, with another gold medal, in the 4x100m medley relay – Phelps’s 23rd gold and 28th podium finish in total. He made a telling contribution to the victory of the American quartet with two supersonic lengths of butterfly. “This all started with one little dream as a kid to change the sport of swimming and try to do something nobody has ever done. Being able to cap it off with these Games... it's just the perfect way to finish. I'm looking forward to starting a new chapter,” said the American star, who won six of his medals in the Carioca pool.The final evening of swimming competition also saw Denmark’s Pernille Blume take the 50m freestyle title (in 24.07), beating the USA’s Simone Manuel by 0.02 seconds, with Belarus’s Aliaksandra Herasimenia winning bronze in 24.11. The women’s 4x100m medley relay was won by the USA (Simone Manuel, Lilly King, Dana Vollmer and Kathleen Baker) in 3:53.13, ahead of Australia and Blume’s Denmark. Finally, Gregorio Paltrinieri took gold in the 1,500m freestyle – one year after being crowned world champion – to claim Italy’s only victory in the Carioca pool. With a time of 14.34:57, the 21-year-old Italian beat off competition from the USA’s Connor Jaeger (14:39.48) and compatriot Gabriele Detti (14:40.86). Overall in Rio, the USA scooped 16 golds out of a possible 32 – 9 of them involving Phelps or Katie Ledecky – for a total of 33 medals out of 97.
