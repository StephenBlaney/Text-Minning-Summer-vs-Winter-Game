The dead are back, but they don't want to party anymore. Now, like everyone else, they want to make a killing in real estate.
They've got their eye on a fixer-upper, too. "Two million bdrms, 750,000 bthrms, 3 riv vu." It's called Pittsburgh.
Thus, "George A. Romero's Land of the Dead" in which the zombies take the Iron City.
As Romero has it -- extrapolating into the near future from his famous (or infamous) zombie canon, "Night of the Living Dead," "Dawn of the Dead" and "Day of the Dead" -- the recently deceased, all 6 billion of them, have turned into shuffling, flesh-eating bags of putrefying, jellified flesh with really nasty hygiene, teeth and wardrobes, some even wearing white after Labor Day. Now they've taken over the world, except for the City of the Three Rivers. There, a few remaining humans have barricaded themselves off from the universal death.
