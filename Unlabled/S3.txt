VIRGINIA THRASHER AND HOÀNG XUÂN VINH: THE FIRST MEDALS
Early in the morning, American teenager Virginia Thrasher won the first gold medal of the Rio Games at the Deodoro shooting range in the women’s 10-metre air rifle event. She started strongly with her first shot in the eight-shooter final, achieving the top score of the competition: 10.9! She then continued where she had left off, setting an Olympic record of 208.0 ahead of the Olympic champion in 2004 and 2008, China’s Du Li. “I’m so happy to kick off the Rio Games with a gold medal for my country,” exclaimed the American.

In the afternoon, Hoàng Xuân Vinh also produced a historic achievement by winning Vietnam’s first-ever Olympic gold medal. Hoàng was victorious in the suspense-filled men’s 10m air pistol event, overcoming his nerves to beat Brazil’s Felipe Almeida Wu with the last shot of the final. “Making this gold medal is a life memory, never forget this,” observed the delighted Vietnamese champion.
