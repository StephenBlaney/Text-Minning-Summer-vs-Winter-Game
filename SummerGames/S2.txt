Early in the morning, American teenager Virginia Thrasher won the first gold medal of the Rio Games at the Deodoro shooting range in the women’s 10-metre air rifle event. She started strongly with her first shot in the eight-shooter final, achieving the top score of the competition: 10.9! She then continued where she had left off, setting an Olympic record of 208.0 ahead of the Olympic champion in 2004 and 2008, China’s Du Li. “I’m so happy to kick off the Rio Games with a gold medal for my country,” exclaimed the American.
