Jamaican sprinting superstar Usain Bolt bowed out of his last-ever individual race at the Olympic Games in a blaze of glory, taking gold in the 200m in 19.78 seconds.
Having already secured the triple over 100m, he repeated the feat over his preferred distance. A triple double that cemented even further the legendary status of the
greatest sprinter of all time and an achievement that is unlikely to be repeated at the Games any time soon! Canada’s Andre De Grasse (20.02) and France’s Christophe
Lemaitre (20.12) accompanied His Majesty Bolt on the podium. Bolt’s clear victory was very much on the cards when he took the lead straight out of the blocks.
