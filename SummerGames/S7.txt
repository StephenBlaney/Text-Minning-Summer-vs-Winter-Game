BADMINTON DOUBLES JOY FOR JAPAN
An incredible final in the women’s doubles saw Japan’s Misaki Matsutomo and Ayaka Takahashi – the world no.1s – fight for every point against Denmark’s determined 
duo Christinna Pedersen and Kamilla Rytter Juhl and draw on every ounce of their ability to dig themselves out of a hole and win a 18-21, 21-9, 21-19 thriller at 
the Riocentro Pavilion 4. Pedersen and Rytter Juhl were leading 19-16 in the final minutes, but the Japanese pair won five successive points to crush their hopes 
and give Japan its first-ever Olympic badminton title. “In the end, all the practice and effort we have put in has paid off,” said Matsumoto.
