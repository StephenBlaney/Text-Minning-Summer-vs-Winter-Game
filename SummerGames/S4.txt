The reigning world champions, Brazil’s Alison Cerutti and Bruno Oscar Schmidt, got the better of Italian pair Paolo Nicolai and Daniele Lupo in the beach volleyball 
final, winning by 2 sets to 0 in a fiery atmosphere at the Copacabana Stadium, to win a gold medal that was celebrated by an entire country. 
Roared on by a sell-out crowd that made light of the driving rain, Cerutti and Schmidt landed Brazil’s first Olympic gold in the sport in 12 years. 
The home favourites were made to work hard for their victory, with the Italians starting both sets strongly, but came back well to win 20-19, 20-17.
