USAIN BOLT IMMORTAL, ALLYSON FELIX AT THE PEAK OF MOUNT OLYMPIA
Usain Bolt succeeded in a bid for a new 100m, 200m and 4x100m triple, unmatched in the history of athletics, and signed off with an iconic farewell to the 
Olympic Games. He took the gold at the Olympic Stadium with Asafa Powell, Yohan Blake and Nickel Ashmeade in 37.27, ahead of Japan (37.60 and an Asian record) and 
Canada (37.64), which placed third after the USA was disqualified for the first baton pass having been outside the zone.
 The giant Jamaican demonstrated once again his ability to delight the spectators after this success.
