This movie has many things I love: it's a zombie movie, it's a road movie, it's a horror comedy, it's gory, but at the same time, it has some substance, but it's not overbearing. Mostly this movie is just really fun and hugely entertaining, which is probably the most important factor. The script is decent, and contains the right amount of wit and quirk without seeming derivative.
